# Define DeliveryLocation class to represent a delivery location
# Greedy algorithm for initial route selection
# Backtracking for rerouting on unexpected events
# Your backtracking logic to reroute based on the unexpected event
#return current_route  # For simplicity, no actual rerouting is performed in this example
